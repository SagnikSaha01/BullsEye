started working cloudflare coming really fresh clay think really strong relationship loved course got take early think gave u confidence knew really hard build business unless theyre consumer even really hard really hard build big business bb space buck month fee there reason everyone end getting sale force selling big company mp thats right knew way would work got point selling ten hundred million dollar today big enterprise question get think nature build network needed data id come clay class think gave u confidence say okay going start focusing provide service free thatll stripped limited bunch way make better anything else thats continue move market point would cross point feature would people could get alternative company like akamai onpremise hardware folk hyperscalers sort emerging point thats exactly happened interesting today level belief enough internet flowed u wed find way make business around really believe mission helping build better internet think two thing together allowed u success get scale today ironic maybe intentional sort boutique interest crime committed across world longer limited geography basically need sort push get people business criminal actually important salesperson created market mp yeah weve never thought way various time hacker like im reformed want get job weve like yeah sure think internet complicated place early people would say who competition said facebook actually still believe thats really true think cloudflare come exist much internet wouldve existed facebook becoming difficult small website owner put hassle people racing behind walled garden tried say hey let give still freedom innovate help kind protection dont worry nasty thing think way amazon shopify facebook cloudflare perfect analogy think try minimum

diverges along way ended different spot expected mp think real story cloudflare wanted put firewall cloud knew order sell jp morgan government big hospital group thing like start small work way made service free didnt expect number problem would create world humanitarian organization sort first customer big security problem small budget signed people would try ddos attack hack various way ideal customer mp well way perfectly ideal customer learned ton would stop hacker kid like wow guy pretty good im going sign friend trying hack hacker u hacker try push u every possible way build domain name registrar terrible business commodity would looked everybody else one else secure came close cloudflarecom getting hacked wouldve disaster like way solve bring inhouse build vpn replacement series product looked folk space like guy cant deal scale complexity everything weve got go build build developer platform wasnt thought going sell built needed needed sandbox environment could build

first money cloudflare pitched say great one question like okay he like going death threat like death threat michelle like even talking laughing uncertainty black belt six sigma want life mp he like youre going youre going piss whole bunch people wouldve never imagined id personally sanctioned russian government supposedly putin kill list wasnt signing think done something different think fact weve made available broadly end touching bunch content mean time time although interesting said two time weve talked content moderation going ask topic dead doesnt seem come much anymore mp well year old september weve three major incident there stuff thats illegal take time kind stuff thats immoral illegal there sort gray line thats three incident year mean time incident five year due another one there going something dont know inherently sit behind enough internet right sued italy spain bunch place largely people football team soccer team dont like people illegally streaming content dont like people illegally streaming content burn bunch bandwidth try shut theyre clever find different way fight kind like trying happen think nature going always controversy thats around frankly thats kind make interesting well find middle really interesting policy debate want come back little bit one thing think defines cloudflare always interesting product week announcement hard parse like company like nvidia back day knew something gpus cuda would throw much spaghetti wall every single gtc theyd twice year people would ask im like well platform everything sort software defined theyre actually releasing library marginally different frame different thing thats sort like cloudflare common architecture commodity hardware purposeful beginning similar function scrappy little startup putting server isp cant afford anything pentium whatever might turn actually ended way build infrastructure mp yeah think really inspired google story think leading search engine google launched altavista built altavista digital equipment corporation digital equipment corporation business sold mainframe launch search engine demo powerful mainframe larry page sergey brin come around stanford student key innovation google isnt actually search ability store process data much efficiently anyone else cheaper faster anyone else could scale mainframe infinitely large effectively taking bunch commodity hardware beginning think firmly camp lee firmly camp there people team firmly camp fight early whether specialized hardware various function take commodity hardware write clever software scheduling everything else needed thats one debate eight people nail salon palo alto could gone either way gone different direction wouldnt company today today still almost every server make cloudflare one different generation think generation well buy server bulk server five major component theyve got network cpu gpu longterm storage shortterm storage ssds ram constantly asking lot innovation there quarter meeting infrastructure team product team call hot cold meeting ask question everyone asks running hot question engineering make efficient deploy hardware place ask equally important question running cold think interesting thing opportunity weve already paid resource exists wild utilized enough go build resource somewhat distasteful maybe analogy somebody came idea selling advertising space urinal bathroom bar tell someone thought wasnt worth anything minute someone youre sudden generating new stream revenue cloudflare asking question time kind extra space extra capacity sell higher margin allows u continue thing whats split business thats opportunistic versus intentional youre pointing long time mp place come hundred page business case mean built cloudflare worker needed fastest growing part business cloudflares niche youve talked fourth cloud past wrote feel like havent heard much late public cloud respond faster expected whether lambda thing like mp think whats happened weve carved lane compete margin distinct lane analogy think company personality like employee various job function hyperscalers aws google microsoft azure job function personality dba database administrator youve ever worked dba brilliant theyre oftentimes kind rigid see database center world entire thing theyre data database fair database kind center world defense mp one way showing color guess version u network administrator funny mentioned actually business stratechery passport stuff work think lot database actually really important mp think lot network think lot database function two thing actually really theyre diametrically opposed there tension purpose database hold onto data store matter purpose network move data get system fast possibly two different thing youre really good database youre probably going really good network youre really good network youre probably going really good database think thats true think networking product hyperscalers kind suck dont actually want data leave database product honestly arent good hyperscaler product certain advantage time want use dont want use theyre definitely tertiary business think bad outcome future cloudflare one world becomes unicloud everyone say hundred percent aws case there lot u good outcome cloudflare future world multicloud case network becomes thing rationalizes different cloud provider area ai actually positive much building ai product fact given motivation company multicloud mp yeah think thats true think also yeah youve got big data set move around way really good there
